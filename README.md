# STOCK-Analysis using ARIMA Model
A Simple Prediction model for stock prices
------------------------------------------
This model is extremely simple, it uses sample data from the alpha vantage api. The data trains on 12 years of histroical data
It gives a prediction along with an expected value,since I am only running ARIMA on this data it is not very accurate.
**NOTE**: This is purely for testing purposes and should not be adapted in real world trading

## What is ARIMA ?
ARIMA stands for auto-regressive integrated moving average. It is simply a forecasting technique that\
projects future values based on it's ability to remain the unchanged.
