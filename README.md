# ARIMA-Analysis
A Simple Prediction model for stock prices
------------------------------------------
This model is extremely simple, it uses sample data from the alpha vantage api\
The data trains on 12 years of histroical data\
It gives a prediction along with an expected value\
Since I am only running ARIMA on this data it is not very accurate\
**NOTE**: This is purely for testing purposes and should not be adapted in real world trading
